# Disaster_Management-
This Disaster Management System is a comprehensive Java-based console application designed to help authorities and organizations efficiently manage disaster events, victims, and rescue operations. The system supports multiple user roles (admin and user) with secure authentication and allows for the registration of new users .. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features:

1.User Authentication & Roles: Secure login system with support for admin and user roles. Admins can add, edit, and delete data, while users can view and search information.

2.Disaster Management: Record and manage disasters with details such as type, location, severity, date, and description.

3.Victim & Rescue Team Tracking: Add and manage victims and rescue teams, including assignment to specific disasters.

4.Data Persistence: All data (disasters, victims, teams, users, logs) is saved to and loaded from files for persistence across sessions.

5.Audit Logs: Every significant action is logged with a timestamp and username for accountability.

6.Undo/Redo: Supports undo and redo for critical operations.

7.Advanced Search & Sorting: Search and filter disasters, victims, and teams by various criteria. Sort data for better analysis.

8.Statistics & Analytics: View statistics such as total disasters, victims, teams, and breakdowns by type or assignment.

9.Alerts & Notifications: Get alerts for disasters without assigned teams or victims not linked to any disaster.

10.Password Management: Users can change their passwords securely.

11.Data Export: Export disaster data to CSV for reporting or external analysis.

12.Disaster Timeline: Maintain and view a timeline of actions for each disaster.

Usage:
The application is suitable for disaster response agencies, NGOs, or educational projects to simulate and manage disaster scenarios, ensuring organized and accountable disaster response.

Technical Overview:
This project leverages core Java features such as object-oriented programming (OOP) for modular class design (using classes, enums, and encapsulation), file I/O for persistent data storage, and Java Collections Framework (ArrayList, List, Map, Stack) for efficient data management.

It utilizes exception handling for robust error management, and functional interfaces (like Function<T, R>) for flexible serialization and deserialization. The application demonstrates user authentication, role-based access control, undo/redo functionality using stacks, and real-time logging with timestamps.

The menu-driven console interface showcases practical use of Java’s Scanner class for user input and control flow structures for interactive command processing.

What's Next?
This Disaster Management System provides a solid foundation for managing disaster events, victims, and rescue operations with robust features like authentication, logging, undo/redo, and analytics. Moving forward, the project can be enhanced by integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing for improved usability, or by developing a web-based version with frameworks like Spring Boot. Additional improvements could include connecting to a database for persistent and scalable data storage, implementing real-time notifications (e.g., email or SMS alerts), and integrating mapping APIs to visualize disaster locations. Advanced features such as role-based permissions, audit trails, and machine learning for disaster prediction can further increase the system’s effectiveness and applicability in real-world scenarios.
